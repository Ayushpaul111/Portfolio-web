2019 was a turning point. I had always tried different things uploading YouTube videos about games, mobile apps, and tech tips. But during my 12th board preparation, my brain was buzzing with ideas. I wanted to explore and learn.

I passed 12th in 2020 and dove into graphic design. I started with YouTube tutorials and simple tools like Picsart, slowly shifting towards Photoshop and Word.

### My First Client

It was a small momo shop. I offered to design a flex banner for free. I told them, _"If people start recognizing your store by the name on that flex, just give me a free plate of momo."_ It sounds funny now, but that was my first deal. Someone even marked the shop on Google Maps.

My first payment? One plate of momo and ₹100. And that’s where my freelance journey began.

### Learning Without Money

I joined a company as a part-timer. Worked there for four months completely unpaid. Just to learn. Eventually, they started paying me ₹500 per month. But money didn’t matter. I was fully immersed in learning and growing.

### Moving to Development & Cold Calling

When I moved to Bangalore for studies, I got into development. At the same time, I started cold calling potential clients. Day by day, I improved. I started making sales, built a team, led them, and learned even more.

Cold calling taught me a lot. Today, I can pitch any product or idea effectively. Within five minutes, I can tell what the other person wants to hear not just what I want to say.

### Where I Am Now

Fast forward to today:

- Worked with around 50+ clients, both in India and internationally
- Collaborated with multiple teams
- Contributed to 5 different companies
- Built a SaaS product that’s now actively used by clients

And it all started with a momo shop and a banner design.

I am still learning every day, let's see where this journey takes me.
