          <h3>
            I am Ayush Paul, a fourth-year student at Dayananda Sagar
            University, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science
            Engineering. In addition to my roles as a developer and designer, I
            have a strong passion for staying abreast of the latest
            technological advancements and trends. Outside of the professional
            realm, I enjoy swimming, having achieved a state-level proficiency
            in the sport. Furthermore, I find solace in music and occasionally
            indulge in cooking as a personal hobby.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="">
            Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of
            working with diverse companies and clients, which has greatly
            contributed to the development of my skills and knowledge. I have
            actively embraced a learning mindset, consistently reflecting on my
            past experiences to enhance my capabilities. Demonstrating my
            ability to thrive under pressure, I have effectively collaborated
            within teams to achieve successful outcomes. As I look forward, I
            remain confident in my capacity to handle pressure in future
            endeavors.
